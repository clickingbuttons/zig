[x] 1. single transcript hash type. move out of stream.
[x] 2. read backpressure, smaller stream buffer
[x] 3. Client recv_hello secp256r1  key share
[x] 4. remove @panic's
[x] 5. better errors than spammy TlsDecodeError. map new errors to TLS alerts. send alert on error.
[x] 6. client state machine union + test
[x] 7. cert formats
[x] 8. verify certs and [x] sigs
9. KeyShare kyber read
10. StreamInterface `readv` instead of `readAll`

1. benchmark
2. store multiple fragments in buffer for less syscalls
3. streaming encode + decode
4. store handshake_cipher somewhere temporary
